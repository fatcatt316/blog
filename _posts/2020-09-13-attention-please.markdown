[Jekyll][jekyll-home]. All the cool kids are talking about it. I decided to try it out and see what all the hubbub was about.

Turns out it's pretty jawsome! There's a learning curve, and I don't have this site looking like I eventually want it, but dangit, it's good enough for now.

I plan using this to post some updates about the software book I'm writing, plus other idears that pop into my noggin.

I hope you enjoy your stay at PeckYeah; por favor stay as long as you like.
